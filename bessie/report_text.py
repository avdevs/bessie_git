We also consider whether you have received treatment or support and assess whether you found it helpful. Physical wellbeing is not a fixed state but a continuum that changes throughout life. Periods of coping and not coping are natural, and these variables shift depending on the presence or absence of other factors. When scoring for this category, we take into account whether an individual or team has any physical health conditions, both diagnosed and undiagnosed, or an ongoing physical complaint and/or disability. We also consider any treatment, support, and whether these factors impact their capacity to work.

    'overview': "Here, we assess whether you regularly experience a good range of positive emotions. It is natural to feel a wide range of emotions, and an absence of this variability can be a strong indicator of stress. Emotions are not static; they are fluid and changeable, both positive and negative. A reluctance to experience certain emotions can lead to anxiety and, over time, may even manifest as physical symptoms. While we do not expect anyone to feel only positive emotions, rarely experiencing them may indicate that additional support is needed. Helping the nervous system recalibrate can allow you to start feeling more at ease. Conversely, insisting on feeling only positive emotions is also a stress response. It is natural to experience negative emotions as well. Learning to be gentle with ourselves and allowing emotions to settle naturally is key to emotional resilience. It is not uncommon, especially in the presence of trauma or significant life challenges, to have reduced access to positive emotions. However, with time and, if needed, professional support, it is possible to gradually reconnect with these emotions and experience them more fully.",

    'overview': "Here, we assess whether you regularly experience a range of negative emotions from time to time. It is natural to feel a wide range of emotions, and an absence of this variability can be a strong indicator of stress. It is not unusual for some people to believe that negative emotions are bad or wrong. We want to assure you that they are not and are perfectly normal. Emotions are how our nervous system communicates to us, alerts us of risk of real and imminent danger, and also alerts us as to when we mistakenly believe that danger is real and imminent. This is why emotions are changeable and vary moment to moment. Emotions allow us to understand the world and people around us and how we can relate to it. They do not have to be acted out; however, when we suppress emotions, it makes it difficult to learn and update information in our mind. Insight, the capacity that we all have as humans, is the ability to have fresh new thinking that we haven't had before; new ideas and our emotions are a way to connect these dots in our subconscious mind. Emotions are not static; they are fluid and changeable, both positive and negative. A reluctance to experience certain emotions can lead to anxiety and, over time, may even manifest as physical symptoms and become persistent. While we do not expect anyone to feel only negative emotions, rarely experiencing them may indicate stress and the presence of avoidance techniques that have become habitual. Whilst our emotions do not have to be expressed to others, it is perfectly safe to acknowledge them to yourself and allow them to pass. Learning to be gentle with ourselves and allowing emotions to settle naturally is key to emotional resilience. It is not uncommon, especially in the presence of trauma or significant life challenges, to have reduced access to positive emotions.

Mental health conditions can feel overwhelming and may lead to concerns about what others, including colleagues and managers, might think.

Many of us have experienced times when we haven't been able to sleep, or might be tempted to skip breaks and instead, opt to continue working. These are indications that stress may be present and rather than reducing stress, often increase the effects. We take into account what you give importance to, such as the quality and quantity of sleep, how you nourish yourself, and whether you take regular breaks and opportunities to refresh and rest. Additionally, we consider how often you engage in physical movement and whether you have the capacity to do so. Self-care is an essential factor in managing stress and sustaining overall wellbeing.

When people become immersed in tasks, they may overlook the importance of taking breaks, often due to workplace culture, role complexity, or the presence of stress itself. However, regular breaks are essential for wellbeing. They allow the nervous system to reset, help reduce stress, and improve cognitive function, focus, and creativity.

For those in roles without set shift patterns, it can be challenging to plan life outside of work, including childcare, hobbies, and holidays.

Research shows that irregular working hours can disrupt the body's natural cycles and rhythms, leading to long-term stress and difficulty maintaining work-life balance.

    'overview': 'Here, we assess whether the presence of any mental health conditions is causing stress and whether this is linked to the workplace.
